What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I used structures to apply object orientation for the direction lights, 3D objects and 3D textures

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I did a divide and conquer type of process. Every new hurtle like, adding texture, creating a 3D object, adding lighting, helped me complete the project as whole.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This tactic can easily be approached on big projects. If you divide and conquer something big, you can make something small compared to how big it is.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I developed different structures signify the different objects in the 3D scene. I also developed different functions for each object in the 3D scene

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach became more object oriented as I continue on to develop every proceeding milestone. This is partially because I understood how each part of the 3D scene works.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

This class helped me adjust to new concepts and programming. This skill will help me proceed through the final semesters of my education.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

This class helped me adjust to new concepts and programming designs. This helps progress my skills as a computer scientist for when I get a job that continues to grow and evolve with new technology trends.
